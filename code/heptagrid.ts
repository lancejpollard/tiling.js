/**
 * MAURICE MARGENSTERN'S FIBONACCI TREE TILE SYSTEM FOR HEPTAGRID {7,3}
 *
 * This module implements Margenstern's groundbreaking work on regular tilings
 * of the hyperbolic plane, specifically the {7,3} tiling (heptagrid) where:
 * - Each tile is a regular heptagon (7 sides)
 * - 3 heptagons meet at each vertex
 * - The tiling has constant negative curvature (hyperbolic geometry)
 *
 * THEORETICAL FOUNDATION:
 * Margenstern proved that every regular tiling of the hyperbolic plane can be
 * systematically addressed using a tree structure combined with Fibonacci coding.
 * This creates a bijective mapping between:
 * 1. Tiles in the infinite hyperbolic tiling
 * 2. Nodes in an infinite binary-like tree
 * 3. Positive integers via Zeckendorf representation
 *
 * KEY INSIGHTS:
 * - The tree structure captures the hierarchical "father-son" relationships
 * - Fibonacci encoding provides a unique, canonical addressing scheme
 * - The tree's binary nature (with controlled branching) maps to Zeckendorf's
 *   property that every integer has unique representation as sum of non-consecutive
 *   Fibonacci numbers
 * - Node colors (black/white) encode geometric properties of tiles
 *
 * APPLICATIONS:
 * - Computational geometry on hyperbolic surfaces
 * - Graph algorithms on infinite regular graphs
 * - Theoretical computer science (decidability problems on tilings)
 * - Mathematical visualization of hyperbolic space

 * where every positive integer has a unique representation as a sum
 * of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers.

 * ZECKENDORF REPRESENTATION (FIBONACCI BASE ENCODING)

 * where i₁ > i₂ + 1 > i₃ + 1 > ... > iₖ ≥ 2
 *
 * GEOMETRIC MEANING: In Margenstern's system, the Fibonacci representation
 * encodes the "address" or "coordinates" of a tile in the hyperbolic tiling.
 * Each bit corresponds to a choice in the tree traversal from root to tile.
 *
 * ALGORITHM: Greedy method starting from largest Fibonacci numbers,
 * skipping consecutive ones to maintain the Zeckendorf property.

 * is the canonical first child in the tree traversal.
 *
 * OPERATION: Append "00" to the Fibonacci code, which corresponds to
 * extending the tree path by two levels down a specific branch.
 *
 * GEOMETRIC INTERPRETATION: This finds a tile that is in a specific
 * geometric relationship to the parent tile in the hyperbolic tiling.
 * The "00" suffix encodes this relationship in the addressing scheme.
 *
 * MATHEMATICAL PROPERTY: This operation preserves the tree structure
 * while providing a deterministic way to generate child nodes.

 *
 * ALGORITHM:
 * 1. If the Fibonacci code ends with "00", this tile IS a preferred son
 *    → Remove "00" suffix to get parent's address
 * 2. Otherwise, use heuristic (simple division by 2)
 *
 * GEOMETRIC MEANING: Moves from a child tile back to its parent tile
 * in the hyperbolic tiling, following the tree structure upward.
 *
 * TREE PROPERTY: This maintains the hierarchical addressing system
 * where each tile knows how to find its ancestors in the tree.

/**
 * NODE COLORING FUNCTION - GEOMETRIC PROPERTY ENCODING
 *
 * THEORY: In Margenstern's system, tiles are colored black or white based on
 * their position in the tree structure. This coloring encodes geometric
 * properties of the tiles in the hyperbolic tiling.
 *
 * TREE GENERATION RULES:
 * - Root (tile 1) is WHITE
 * - WHITE nodes have 3 children: BLACK, WHITE, WHITE
 * - BLACK nodes have 2 children: BLACK, WHITE
 *
 * GEOMETRIC SIGNIFICANCE: The coloring corresponds to different types of
 * geometric positions in the {7,3} tiling. This may relate to:
 * - Distance from the center of the hyperbolic disk
 * - Orientation relative to geodesics
 * - Local geometric environment (how many edges connect to boundary)
 *
 * COMPUTATIONAL METHOD: Breadth-first tree traversal following the branching rules.
 * For large n, this could be optimized using the Fibonacci code directly.

/**
 * NEIGHBOR COMPUTATION - HYPERBOLIC GEOMETRY ADJACENCY
 *
 * THEORY: In the {7,3} hyperbolic tiling, each heptagonal tile has exactly
 * 7 neighbors (one adjacent to each of its 7 edges). Margenstern's system
 * provides formulas to compute these neighbors using tree relationships.
 *
 * GEOMETRIC CONTEXT:
 * - {7,3} means regular heptagons with 3 meeting at each vertex
 * - This creates negative curvature (hyperbolic geometry)
 * - Unlike Euclidean tilings, the number of tiles grows exponentially with distance
 *
 * MARGENSTERN'S NEIGHBOR FORMULAS:
 * The 7 neighbors depend on:
 * - f = parent(n): the "father" tile in the tree
 * - s = preferredSon(n): the "preferred son" child tile
 * - The color (white/black) of the current tile
 *
 * FORMULA INTERPRETATION:
 * - WHITE tiles: [f, n-1, s-1, s, s+1, s+2, n+1]
 * - BLACK tiles: [f, f-1, n-1, s, s+1, s+2, n+1]
 *
 * The differences reflect the local geometric environment around
 * white vs black tiles in the hyperbolic tiling.
 *
 * MATHEMATICAL SIGNIFICANCE: These formulas encode the complex adjacency
 * relationships in hyperbolic space using simple arithmetic on the
 * Fibonacci-based addressing system.
