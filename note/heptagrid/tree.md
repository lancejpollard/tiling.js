# The Heptagrid and the Fibonacci Tree

This document summarizes Maurice Margenstern’s approach to modeling the hyperbolic plane using the {7,3} tiling and the Fibonacci tree.

## What is the Heptagrid?

* The heptagrid is a tiling of the hyperbolic plane using regular heptagons, where three heptagons meet at each vertex.
* It is described by the Schläfli symbol {7,3}, which means:

  * Each polygon has 7 sides.
  * 3 polygons meet at each vertex.
* This tiling is only possible in hyperbolic geometry because the angle sum at each vertex is less than 360 degrees.

## Why Use a Tree?

* A single sector (wedge) of the heptagrid can be mapped to a tree structure.
* This tree helps:

  * Assign coordinates to tiles.
  * Navigate from one tile to another.
  * Run algorithms or cellular automata on the grid.

## The Fibonacci Tree

* The tree used is based on the Fibonacci sequence.
* The root of the tree is the central tile.
* Each node in the tree corresponds to a tile in the sector.
* The number of nodes at each level grows like the Fibonacci sequence:

  * 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...

## Two Types of Nodes

* Nodes in the tree are either white or black:

  * White nodes have 3 children: black, white, white.
  * Black nodes have 2 children: black, white.
* This branching structure creates a tree whose level sizes follow the Fibonacci recurrence.

## Numbering the Tree

* Nodes are numbered breadth-first: starting at 1 (the root), then numbering level by level from left to right.
* This ensures that each node has a unique index.

## Fibonacci Base Coordinates

* Each tile’s number is converted into a **Zeckendorf representation**: a sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers.

  * Example: 6 = 5 + 1 → Fibonacci code = `1001`.
* This code serves as a coordinate or address in the tree.
* The Fibonacci base avoids two consecutive 1s to ensure uniqueness.

## Preferred Son and Parent

* The **preferred son** of a node is the child whose code is formed by appending `00` to the parent’s code.
* To recover the parent from a preferred son, remove the trailing `00`.
* This structure allows efficient path and neighbor computations.

## Neighbor Computation

* Each tile in the heptagrid has 7 neighbors.
* Using Margenstern's model, you can compute all neighbors of a tile directly from its number.
* Neighboring tiles include:

  * The parent
  * Siblings or nearby nodes
  * The preferred son and its immediate neighbors

## Applications

* This model has been used to:

  * Build universal Turing machines on the hyperbolic plane.
  * Implement cellular automata with exponential space.
  * Explore complexity classes such as PSPACE using hyperbolic CAs.
* It enables local computations that are efficient and scalable in hyperbolic geometry.

## Summary

* The {7,3} heptagrid is modeled using a Fibonacci-labeled tree.
* Each tile receives a unique, efficiently computable coordinate.
* The system supports fast navigation, neighbor lookup, and formal computation in hyperbolic space.

## Relevance and Applications

The heptagrid Fibonacci tree model, as developed by Maurice Margenstern, provides a powerful structure for working with hyperbolic geometry, particularly the regular {7,3} tiling.

### Compact Coordinate System

* Every tile in a sector of the heptagrid is uniquely identified by a coordinate derived from a Fibonacci tree.
* These coordinates are based on Zeckendorf representations (sums of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers).
* The preferred-son property (code + `00`) allows efficient encoding and navigation through the tree.

### Efficient Algorithms in Hyperbolic Space

* Paths to the root and between nodes can be computed in linear time using only the coordinate string.
* Neighbor computation is also linear-time and rule-based, independent of geometric embedding.
* These properties make this system suitable for formal algorithmic manipulation of hyperbolic space.

### Cellular Automata and Universality

* The coordinate structure enables implementation of deterministic and non-deterministic cellular automata.
* Margenstern constructed weakly and strongly universal CAs using this model with as few as 6 states.
* This structure supports efficient simulation of Turing machines within hyperbolic tilings.

### Applications Beyond Computation

* Supports analysis of symmetry groups and motion patterns in the tiling.
* Provides tools for reflection-based motion, discrete geometric group theory, and combinatorial constructions in hyperbolic geometry.
* Useful in the study of automatic groups and the geometry of abstract rewriting systems.

This model creates a practical framework for studying and manipulating infinite hyperbolic tilings using finite, structured, and computable representations.
